#HyperFlow: a distributed workflow execution engine

##Description

HyperFlow allows one to execute workflows defined as a collection of tasks connected through input and output ports. The internal workflow model of HyperFlow is based on Discrete-Event Dynamic Systems and Finite State Machines theory.   

##Getting started

Currently the recommended way to try HyperFlow is as follows:
* Clone the hyperflow repository
* Install dependencies (in `hyperflow` directory): npm install -d
* Get the latest node.js (http://nodejs.org)
* Get the latest Redis server (http://redis.io)
* Start the redis server
* Run example workflows in the `test` directory, e.g. node splitter.test.js
* Look at sample workflows in the `workflows` directory
